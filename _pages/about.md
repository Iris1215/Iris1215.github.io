I am a third-year Computer Science Ph.D. student in School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence at Arizona State University, working with [Dr. Hasti Seifi](https://hastiseifi.com/). Prior to that, I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2023 with a master degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and I graduated from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University in May 2021 with a bachelor degree in Electronic and Information Engineering.
